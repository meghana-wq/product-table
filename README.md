This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).


##Product Management App

It lets you **add**, **view**, **edit**, and **soft delete** products.  
All data is saved in your browser‚Äôs **LocalStorage**, so it stays even after refreshing the page.
